# Blind Pomodoro

A Pomodoro timer that doesn't show time during work sessions

## Concept

Traditional Pomodoro timers display time, which actually hinders concentration.

**Problems**
- Checking remaining time disrupts focus
- Working becomes mechanical in the final minutes
- Time monitoring divides cognitive resources

**Solution**
- No time display during work sessions
- Timer visible only during breaks
- Flow experience freed from time awareness
